This plugin will display the damage you did to a boss and how long it took to kill.

When in combat with a boss, an overlay is displayed, detailing how much damage you have dealt and what percentage of the boss' total health that is.

Useful when bossing with other players.

## How to use
If you only want to know how much damage you did and how long the kill took, then no configuration is required. If however, you want to see other player's damage, then you need to use the default RuneLite Party plugin to create a party and invite the other players.

## Features

- Overlay with damage information (togglable)
- Chat log message on boss death, detailing your damage, total damage, percentage and kill time (togglable)
- Option to display either total damage done or DPS
- Option to automatically hide overlay when boss dies
- Option to add your own NPCs to be tracked by Name
- Shows other user's damage, if they are in a party with you
- Option to sort the list of players in party by damage done in descending order
